9:SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
  While cloning, with https we need to provide username and password and with SSH, SSH key passphrase is required.
10:git reset hard Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded. 
   git reset soft Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.
